Ticket-1: Configure a Local Docker Registry on Kubernetes

Set up a Kubernetes cluster: If you don't already have a Kubernetes cluster, you'll need to create one. 

Tools like Minikube or kind (Kubernetes in Docker) can be used for local development.

Deploy Docker Registry: Use Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) to deploy a Docker Registry to your Kubernetes cluster. You can use the official Docker Registry image.

Expose Registry: Make sure to expose the Docker Registry service so that you can access it from your local machine.

Test: Verify that you can access the registry both from your local machine (via the exposed service) and within the Kubernetes cluster.

Ticket-2: Deploy a Python Web Application to Kubernetes

Create a Python Web App: Develop a simple Python web application that responds with "Hello Kube" when accessed at the root URL.

Build Docker Image: Create a Dockerfile for your Python app, build the Docker image, and tag it appropriately.

Push to Docker Registry: Push the Docker image to the local Docker Registry configured in Ticket-1.

Helm Chart for Web App: Create a Helm chart for your Python web application. Define the deployment, service, and any necessary configuration parameters in the chart.

Deploy with Helm: Use Helm to deploy the Python web application to Kubernetes. Provide values for any required Helm chart parameters.

Verify: Access the application's URL to ensure it displays "Hello Kube" as expected.
================================================================================================================================================
Ticket-3: Create a Helm Chart for the Web Application

Helm Chart Structure: Set up the directory structure for your Helm chart with appropriate files (values.yaml, deployment.yaml, service.yaml, etc.).

Define Deployment: In the deployment.yaml file, define the Kubernetes Deployment for your web application, including container specifications.

Define Service: In the service.yaml file, define the Kubernetes Service to expose your web application.

Parameterize: Use values.yaml to parameterize your Helm chart, allowing for customization of values like container image, ports, and environment variables.

Package Helm Chart: Package the Helm chart into a .tgz file.

===================================================================================================================================================

Ticket-4: Automate Deployment with Ansible

Ansible Playbook Structure: Create an Ansible playbook and directory structure for your automation tasks.

Namespace Configuration: Use Ansible to create Kubernetes namespaces (e.g., dev, uat, prod) if they don't exist.

Deploy Helm Chart: Use the helm Ansible module to deploy the Helm chart created in Ticket-3 to the desired namespace. Pass appropriate values based on the environment (dev, uat, prod).

Environment-Specific Message: Modify the web application environment variable using Ansible to display "Hello {{ENV}} Kube," where {{ENV}} depends on the environment.

Wait Mechanism: Implement a wait mechanism, such as using the wait_for Ansible module, to ensure the deployment is successful. Fail the playbook if the deployment fails.
